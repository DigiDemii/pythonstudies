# pythonstudies
A collection of things I have learned whilst studying Python, hopefully they will be helpful to you too!

<strong>Collection</strong>:

<b>strings.py</b> : This is a collection of methods and how they work with strings.
<br>
<b>zen.py</b> : A fun thing I discovered that prints 19 of 20 Python design principles into the terminal. The source can be found here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
